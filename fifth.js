Challenge 5
Construct a json api with the ExpressJS Framework. You will not use a database. You will mock a database of blogposts in a seperate JS file with the following starter data ***Do in Python if you can with flask***
const mockBlog = [
    {
        id: 1,
        title: 'First Blog Post',
        description: 'My first blog post!'
    },
    {
        id: 2,
        title: 'Second Blog Post',
        description: 'My Second blog post!'
    },
    {
        id: 3,
        title: 'Third Blog Post',
        description: 'My Third blog post!'
    }
];
module.exports = mockBlog
